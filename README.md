# Nourish. App

**Welcome to Nourish!** 
Our Final group project as a team of five. 
The School Of Code set us a task to create anything we can solve a problem to, 
so we wanted to create something meaningful. It became apparent that something
we all cared about was leading a more sustainable life, and with this eating more sustainably.

Imports of food have a high carbon footprint so we decided to make an app that 
helps to educate people about food that is in season right now, along with recipe
inspiration for those particular ingredients. 

## Research/Ideation Phase

During the early development process, we created multiple User Personas to represent the
different types of people who might use our product and from there, we created 
user stories.

### User Persona
For example, meet **Jaya**; a young professional working in Notting Hill. She likes 
to cook using fresh ingredients and has been feeling uninspired recently due to a 
lack of options. Occasionally, she hosts dinner parties for friends and will make 
an effort to pick ingredients that are fresher. She has recently become more 
health-conscious and would like to eat more organic food if possible as she is 
becoming increasingly aware of the harmful effects of the pesticides that are 
used on out-of-season produce imported from countries with less-stringent regulations. She would now like to focus on making more dishes using seasonal produce but is having trouble finding these recipes at her fingertips.

Based on this user persona, we refined our ideas by using the **Disney Ideation** model.
We jotted down our ideas on our **Miro board** and decided on the core features we 
would like to include in our MVP. Following this process, we sent out surveys 
to the wider School of Code community to receive feedback on what features they
would use in a seasonal food app. The results highlighted that the most popular 
feature was the ability to save recipes to your favourites.

To quickly learn the scale of our product, we created **lo and hi-fidelity prototypes
using Figma.**  
We adopted an iterative approach - based on feedback as well as usability 
issues we encountered, we came back to these designs to make appropriate 
adjustments as the project developed.


### Component Structure
Once our low and high fidelity prototypes were completed, we went through the 
design and organised the elements into a hierarchy of **components and 
sub-components.** This allowed us to easily spot reusable components, along with 
their variations (state, props, behaviour) and gave the team a good sense of the
scope of work ahead. This aided our workflow as any team member could jump in, 
pick an isolated component from the backlog and code it.


## Tech Stack
We initially thought about exploring new technologies however we agreed on using
the PERN stack so that we could consolidate our knowledge and add more value to the 
app in a short amount of time.

We used jest, super test, and cypress to test our app applying some tests primarily
around the key components, and lastly end-to-end tests to consolidate the user journey.

Git, Heroku and Netlify had a crucial role in our CI and CD.

## Team Management
We began each day with a team standup in which we recap the previous day. We kept 
feedback cycles short by meeting before breaks to update the whole team. We would 
end the day with a retrospective in which we would reflect on the day.
We used a series of sprints to achieve the MVP This was through the use of a 
Trello board as it broke down tasks that needed to be done.

## Future Vision
- Filter by dietary requirements when searching for recipes eg, vegetarian, vegan, gluten free.
- Ability to customise saved recipes - swap out ingredients they donâ€™t like or altered ingredient amounts. 
- User profile that includes a dashboard of their details, favourite recipe, saved dietary requirement, location and shopping list.
- Map function so they can search for local market shops in the nearby area to but local produce.
